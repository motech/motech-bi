* Schema Workbench - 3.3
* Saiku Analytics - 2.2

Git
* Clone / update your git repository 
* Configure line endings - http://help.github.com/line-endings/


h2. 2. Developing ETL Workflow 
- Create file repository with the base directory as the 'ETL' directory under the motech-bi project
- Connect to the repository
- Set MOTECH_ETL_HOME environment variable
- Configure jndi connections under spoon_home/simple-jndi/jdbc.properties
- Sync database model (mysql workbench) with local database


Main job runs the sub jobs, dimension_job and facts_job

Developing Mondrian Schema Workflow
- Open Schema workbench
- Configure schema workbench 
- Add mysql driver 
- Make your changes to schema
- Open MDX Query window
 Test Connection in Query window 


h2. 3. Deployment to Production

h3. Configure and run ETL
* Configure JNDI settings in $PDI_HOME/simple-jndi/jdbc.properties and $./etl/simple-jndi/jdbc.properties

* Run ETL scripts - ./etl/load_dw.sh (Usage: load_dw.sh <PDI_HOME> <DB_USER> <DB_PASSWORD>)



h3. ETL TIPS
The granularity of the date dimension is days and not minutes or seconds. Thus use the date function in sql to convert datetimes to Date values otherwise, the corresponding date keys will not be found. 

h3. MDX TIPS
Excellent MDX tutorial - http://www.iccube.com/support/documentation/mdx/index.html

Understand the following concepts - dimensions, measures, members, cells, hierarchies, aggregations, levels and member properties as well as Members, Tuples and Sets

Understand hierarchy navigation for calculated measure formulas

If the name of a hierarchy is not specified (which is most cases) then it defaults to the name of the hierarchy.
